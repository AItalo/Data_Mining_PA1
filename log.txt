Manual clean up of auto-prices-nodups.txt:
For models with initial non-match ["audi 100 ls", "bmw 2002", "chevy c20", "dodge d200", "ford f250", "peugeot 504", "saab 99e"] : 
Instance of model exists in auto-prices-nodups.txtwith model year 71, while separate instance of model exists in auto-mpg-nodups.txt with model year 70 and no match.
Cases resolved by editing auto-prices-nodups.txt and changing model year to match instance in auto-mpg-nodups.txt
New dataset saved in auto-prices-nodups-clean.txt
For model with initial non-match ["toyoto corona mark ii (sw)"] :
Misspelling of "toyoto", corrected to "toyota"
